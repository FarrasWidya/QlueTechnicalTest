concurrency vs parallelism

lets say 3 person have 1 things to do.
If they do it in turns (lets say person 1 do it for 20% and pass it to person 2 and he continue for another 40% and last person finish it), they use method called concurrency
If they do it simultaneously on their own, they use method called parallelism
